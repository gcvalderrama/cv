<p>
    Uncle bob , focus on the names and not in the types because now we have a huge quantity of computing power
</p>
<p>
    They must be small , to save time for you and every body 
    Keep your functions small and few arguments ( avoid switch and if sentences), tree arguments max Uncle Bob
    No booleans arguments, try to have two functions instead 
    No output arguments, uncle Bob.
    Don't use null as boolean. 
    Don't use switch statement
    Defense Programming means you don't trust in your test. This is incorrect for internal code but is neccesary for APIs 
    Must be well named    
    THe public stuff needs to be in the top and privates at the bottom 

    Switch is the antitesis of polimorfis 

    A system that is independable deployable is independent developlabe

</p>
<p>
    Command Query Seggregation , can manage the side effects 
    Functions without side effects must return values get_address
    Functions with side effects must not return values and throw exceptions 
    Tell don't ask, tell another object what to do but don't ask about his state
    LoD is a specific case of loose coupling
    Law of demeter, you may call methods of objects that are 

        Passed as arguments
        Created Locally
        Instance Variables
        Globals

    You may not call methods that are:
    
        Returned from a previous method call 


        Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units “closely” related to the current unit. Or: Each unit should only talk to its friends; Don’t talk to strangers.

        Don’t talk to strangers

    Function Programming
    Recurseve throuhg a set or Functions no side effects 

    Don't return inside a while 
    Reduce use of break in for or whiles
    It is more important make the code understandable than make your code works "Uncle Bob"

    Exceptions should be scoped to our classes, oh yes they should.

    One responsability, you must extract functions until you can not do that more.
